# Wes Bos's YouTube Ad Skip

Inspired by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/827268492936114176), this extension will continously run some code in the background of all YouTube pages and wait for an ad to show up. When it does, it'll skip it for you!

No bulky ad blockers. Just about 30 lines of JavaScript.
